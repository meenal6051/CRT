## We Know that the parameter of a constructor can be any type except that of the class to which it belongs.

    class Test
    {
       int a;
         public:
        Test(Test obj){


       }
    };
-->> Is Invalid!!

** but a constructor can accept a refrence to its own class as a parameter. thus:

   class Test
     {
         int a;
         public:
         Test(Test &obj){


         }
    };

## Is Valid &n called the "Copy Construtor"
-> so a Copy Constructor is used to declare and initialize an object from another object.
    Test o2(o1);             OR               Test o2 = o1;

** A copy constructor takes a refrence to an object of the same class as itself  as an argument.
** The process of initializing through a copy constructor is k/a copy initialization.
** Note this --
           abc o2;
           o2 = o1;
    Legal but noy invoke the copy constructor.
